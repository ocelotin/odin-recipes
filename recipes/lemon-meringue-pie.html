    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 175 degrees C (350 degrees F).</li>
      <li>
        To make the filling: Whisk 1 cup sugar, flour, cornstarch, and salt
        together in a medium saucepan; stir in water, lemon juice, and lemon
        zest. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until mixture
        comes to a boil. Stir in butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place egg yolks in a small bowl and gradually whisk in 1/2 cup of hot
        sugar mixture. Whisk egg yolk mixture back into remaining sugar mixture.
        Bring to a boil and continue to cook while stirring constantly until
        thick. Remove from heat; pour filling into baked pastry shell.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make the meringue: Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl
        until foamy. Gradually add sugar, continuing to beat until stiff peaks
        form. Spread meringue over pie filling, sealing the edges at the crust.
      </li>

        Bake in preheated oven until meringue is golden brown, about 10 minutes.
